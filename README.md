# ds
All my na√Øve Data Structure implementations from when I was in DS course.

Arrays - An assignment where I had to use global / local array strucutres and apply a bunch of different functions such as a prediction algorithm as well data cleaning and pre-processing. Ended up not finishing the assignment due to commitments but managed to do whatever I attempted in a day.

Linked_List - An assignment where I had to implemet a variety of linked lists to simulate a music player. Completed but with minor bugs that I couldn't pinpoint.

* Code is old and in its raw form. No revision is applied. I just wanted to save it here as a throwback to when I started enjoying coding in C++.
